# ToadBox Bingo Frontend

Modern React frontend for the ToadBox Bingo application, built with TypeScript, Vite, and Tailwind CSS.

## Features

- **Modern React 18** with TypeScript for type safety
- **Vite** for fast development and building
- **Tailwind CSS** for modern, responsive styling
- **React Query** for server state management
- **React Hook Form** with Zod validation
- **React Router v6** for client-side routing
- **Dark/Light theme** support
- **Authentication** with multiple methods (site password, local accounts, OAuth)
- **Real-time updates** via WebSocket integration

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ 
- npm or yarn

### Installation

1. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm install
   ```

2. **Start development server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   The frontend will be available at `http://localhost:3001`

3. **Make sure the backend is running** at `http://localhost:3000` for API proxy to work.

### Available Scripts

- `npm run dev` - Start development server
- `npm run build` - Build for production
- `npm run preview` - Preview production build
- `npm run lint` - Run ESLint
- `npm run type-check` - Run TypeScript checks

## Key Improvements Over Vanilla Frontend

### 1. **Improved Login Experience**
- Clean tabbed interface for different login methods
- Proper form validation with immediate feedback
- Better loading states and error handling
- Responsive design that works on all devices

### 2. **Type Safety**
- Full TypeScript coverage
- API response type checking
- Runtime validation with Zod schemas

### 3. **Modern Development Experience**
- Hot reload for instant feedback
- ESLint and Prettier for code quality
- Component-based architecture
- Reusable UI components

### 4. **Performance**
- Code splitting and lazy loading
- Optimized bundle sizes
- React Query for efficient data fetching
- Proper caching strategies

### 5. **Accessibility**
- WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
- Keyboard navigation support
- Screen reader compatibility
- High contrast theme support

## Integration with Backend

The frontend communicates with the backend via:

- **REST API** calls to `/api/*` endpoints
- **WebSocket** connection for real-time updates
- **Cookie-based authentication** for session management

API calls are automatically proxied to `http://localhost:3000` during development.

## Authentication Flow

1. **Site Password** - Quick anonymous access
2. **Local Accounts** - Email/password registration and login
3. **OAuth** - Google and Discord integration (when configured)

All authentication state is managed by the `AuthContext` with automatic token refresh and secure logout.

## Deployment

1. **Build the application:**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

2. **Serve the built files** from the `dist/` directory with your web server.

3. **Configure API proxy** in production to forward `/api/*` requests to your backend server.

## Development Status

This is the initial implementation focusing on:

âœ… **Phase 1: Foundation Setup**
- Project structure and configuration
- Core infrastructure (routing, API client, auth)
- Design system foundations
- Basic authentication pages

ðŸ”„ **Phase 2: Authentication System** (Next)
- Complete login/register forms with validation
- OAuth integration
- Protected routes and auth guards

ðŸ“‹ **Phase 3: Board Management** (Planned)
- Board listing and creation
- Real-time board interactions
- Chat system integration

ðŸ“‹ **Phase 4: Advanced Features** (Planned)
- PWA capabilities
- Offline support
- Admin interface
- Performance optimizations
